# Detekt rules for Jetpack Compose

[![MavenCentral](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/ru.kode/detekt-rules-compose?versionPrefix=1.2.2)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/ru.kode/detekt-rules-compose)

A set of [Detekt](https://detekt.dev) rules to help prevent common errors in projects using Jetpack Compose.

# Rules

Here are some highlights of rules in this rule set:

- `ReusedModifierInstance` finds usages of `modifier` parameter on non-top-level children of a composable function. This tends to happen during refactorings and often leads to incorrect rendering of a composable

- `UnnecessaryEventHandlerParameter` suggests hoisting event argument passing to the upper level which often simplifies individual composable components

- `ModifierHeightWithText` suggests using `Modifier.heightIn()` instead of `Modifier.height()` on a layouts which have `Text` children, so that if the text turns out to be long and would wrap, layout will not cut it off

- `ComposableEventParameterNaming` ensures that all event handler parameters of composable functions are named in the same Compose-like style, i.e. they have `on` prefix and do not use past tense

- `ComposableParametersOrdering` suggests separating required an optional parameters of the composable function into groups

- `ModifierParameterPosition` ensures that `modifier` is declared as a first parameter

- `ModifierDefaultValue` ensures that `modifier` parameter has a correct default value

- `MissingModifierDefaultValue` checks if `modifier` default value is specified

- `PublicComposablePreview` finds and reports composable previews which are not marked as `private`

- `TopLevelComposableFunctions` ensures that all composable functions are top-level functions (disabled by default)

- `ComposableFunctionName` ensures that Composable functions which return Unit should start with upper-case while the ones that return a value should start with lower case

- and others...

Rules can be individually turned `on` or `off` in the configuration file.  
More detailed rule descriptions with code snippets can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/appKODE/detekt-rules-compose/wiki).

# Installation and configuration

Add detekt rules plugin in your `build.gradle` (or use any other [supported method](https://detekt.dev/docs/introduction/extensions#let-detekt-know-about-your-extensions)):
```
dependencies {
  detektPlugins("ru.kode:detekt-rules-compose:1.2.2")
}
```
and then add this configuration section to your `detekt-config.yml` to activate the rules:
```
compose:
  ReusedModifierInstance:
    active: true
  UnnecessaryEventHandlerParameter:
    active: true
  ComposableEventParameterNaming:
    active: true
  ComposableParametersOrdering:
    active: true
  ModifierHeightWithText:
    active: true
  ModifierParameterPosition:
    active: true
  ModifierDefaultValue:
    active: true
  MissingModifierDefaultValue:
    active: true
  PublicComposablePreview:
    active: true
  TopLevelComposableFunctions:
    active: true
  ComposableFunctionName:
    active: true
```
